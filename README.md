# Spring Boot Project - bookshare
## Description

This is my first GitHub repository. In my free time I am working on my project "bookshare".

This project is a Spring Boot application as the backend, based on a Gradle project created by Spring Initializer with Web dependency.
I created this project with the tutorial series Java Backend Development from <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrW9Tlul4Cf-IG40I6uuX8tojzsBvkGx8" target="_blank">TotalSurpriseException</a>

For this project I am using several technologies. For backend:

<ul>
<li>Java and Kotlin</li>
<li>Spring Framework</li>
  <li>IntelliJ IDEA</li>
  <li>RESTful API</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
</ul>

I built the frontend separately as its own project and used some kind of an API. In this case google-books seems fitting. You can find this project <a href="https://github.com/BS-Igor/bookshare" target="_blank">here</a>.
For the frontend area I am using currently:

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Vanilla JS</li>
  <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
  </ul>
  
## Next steps

<ul>
  <li>Customize API</li>
  <li>Session Management with Spring Boot</li>
  <li>And much more&hellip;</li>
  </ul>

Updates on my project are coming soon.
